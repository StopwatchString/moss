# moss
My header-only C++ utility stack.

Contains both self-created utilities and 3rd party utilities that I think are worth having on hand. Licenses for 3rd party tools are kept under `/licenses`. Tools created by me are contained within the `moss::` namespace.

## `moss/timer.h`

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| moss::timer::immutable | A timer whose start time is set at creation and cannot be set again. |
| moss::timer::resettable | A timer whose start time can be reset arbitrarily. |
| moss::timer::statistic | A timer that takes multiple measurements and provides some automatic statistics about the timings taken. Sample count can optionally be limited, and samples can be reset at any time. |
| moss::timer::rolling | The same as a statistic timer except samples are always unlimited and are automatically purged past a given time limit. |
